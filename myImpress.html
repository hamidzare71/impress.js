<body class="impress-not-supported">

    <!--For example this fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body -->
    <div class="fallback-message">
        <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a
            simplified version of this presentation.</p>
        <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
    </div>



    
    <!--
    
    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.
    
    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    Often you don't need to use any attributes here, but for educational purposes I have used all of them below.

    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
    
    When authoring impress.js presentations, you should target some screen size, which you can define here.
    The default is 1024 x 768. You should write your CSS as if this is the screen size used for the
    presentation. When you present your presentation on a screen (or browser window) of different size,
    impress.js will automatically scale the presentation to fit the screen. The minimum and maximum limits
    to this scaling can also be defined here.
    
    NOTE: I intend to change the defaults to target HD screens in 2021. So you may want to make a habit
    of explicitly defining these attributes for now, to avoid any disruption when the defaults change.
    
    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective
    
    Plugins:
    
    We set the default time for autoplay plugin to 7 seconds. Autoplay will automatically advance
    to next slide after a timeout expires.
-->
    <div id="impress" data-transition-duration="1000" data-width="1024" data-height="768" data-max-scale="3"
        data-min-scale="0" data-perspective="1000" data-autoplay="7">

        <!--
        
        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
        
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
        
        It will not be rotated or scaled.
        
        --------
        Plugins: For first slide, set the autoplay time to a custom 10 seconds.

    This is a UI plugin. You can read more about plugins in src/plugins/README.md.
    For now, I'll just tell you that this adds some graphical controls to navigate the
    presentation. In the CSS file you can style them as you want. We've put them bottom right.
    -->
    <div id="impress-toolbar"></div>



    <!--
    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
    
    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.
    
    ...
    
    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
    
    Just sayin' ;)
-->
    <div class="hint">
        <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate. <br />
            Press 'P' to launch speaker console.</p>
    </div>
    <script>
        if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) {
            document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Swipe left or right to navigate</p>";
        }
    </script>




    <!--
    Last, but not least.
    
    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
    
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
-->
    <script src="js/impress.js"></script>
    <script>impress().init();</script>


    <!--
    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
    
    Just store the result of the call:
    
        var api = impress();
    
    and you will get three functions you can call:
    
        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( stepIndex | stepElementId | stepElement, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
    
    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
    
    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.
